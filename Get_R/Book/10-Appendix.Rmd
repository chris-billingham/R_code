### Web Crawler

rvest by xpath:
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Load rvest
library(rvest)

# Hadley Wickham's Wikipedia page
test_url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham"

# Read the URL stored as "test_url" with read_html()
test_xml <- read_html(test_url)

# Print test_xml
test_xml

# xpath 
test_node_xpath='//*[contains(concat( \" \", @class, \" \" ), concat( \" \", \"vcard\", \" \" ))]'

# Use html_node() to grab the node with the XPATH stored as `test_node_xpath`
node <- html_node(x = test_xml, xpath = test_node_xpath)

# Print the first element of the result
node[[1]]
```


Read table:
```{r eval=FALSE}
url='https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2017.html'
xml <- read_html(url)
all_table <- html_table(xml)
all_table
all_table[[1]] # first table

# find table with table name(xpath)
node <- html_node(x = xml, xpath = '//*[@id="confs_standings_E"]')
table <- html_table(node)
table
```
rvest by CSS:

Example:
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Load httr
library(httr)
# The API url
base_url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php"
# Set query parameters
query_params <- list(action = "parse", 
  page = "Hadley Wickham", 
  format = "xml")
# Get data from API
resp <- GET(url = base_url, query = query_params)
# Parse response
resp_xml <- content(resp)
```


### Big Data
R lets you write data analysis code quickly. With a bit of care, you can also make your code easy to read, which means that you can easily maintain your code too. In many cases, R is also fast enough at running your code.

Unfortunately, R requires that all your data be analyzed in memory (RAM), on a single machine. This limits how much data you can analyze using R. There are a few solutions to this problem, including using Spark.

#### Spark
Spark is an open source cluster computing platform. That means that you can spread your data and your computations across multiple machines, effectively letting you analyze an unlimited amount of data. The two technologies complement each other strongly. By using R and Spark together you can write code fast and run code fast!

sparklyr is an R package that lets you write R code to work with data in a Spark cluster. It has a dplyr interface, which means that you can write (more or less) the same dplyr-style R code, whether you are working with data on your machine or on a Spark cluster.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Load sparklyr
library(sparklyr)
#spark_install()
# Connect to your Spark cluster
spark_conn <- spark_connect("local")
# Print the version of Spark
spark_version(spark_conn)
# Disconnect from Spark
spark_disconnect(spark_conn)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}

# Load dplyr
library(dplyr)
# Explore track_metadata structure
str(track_metadata)
# Connect to your Spark cluster
spark_conn <- spark_connect("local")
# Copy track_metadata to Spark
track_metadata_tbl <- copy_to(spark_conn, track_metadata)
# List the data frames available in Spark
src_tbls(spark_conn)
# Link to the track_metadata table in Spark
track_metadata_tbl <- tbl(spark_conn, "track_metadata")
# See how big the dataset is
dim(track_metadata_tbl)
# See how small the tibble is
object_size(track_metadata_tbl)
# Disconnect from Spark
spark_disconnect(spark_conn)


```

sail the Seven Seas

In the 9th century AD, author Ya'qubi wrote:

Whoever wants to go to China must cross seven seas, each one with its own color and wind and fish and breeze, completely unlike the sea that lies beside it. The first of them is the Sea of Fars, which men sail setting out from Siraf. It ends at Ra??s al-Jumha; it is a strait where pearls are fished. The second sea begins at Ra??s al-Jumha and is called Larwi. It is a big sea, and in it is the Island of Waqwaq and others that belong to the Zanj. These islands have kings. One can only sail this sea by the stars. It contains huge fish, and in it are many wonders and things that pass description. The third sea is called Harkand, and in it lies the Island of Sarandib, in which are precious stones and rubies. Here are islands with kings, but there is one king over them. In the islands of this sea grow bamboo and rattan. The fourth sea is called Kalah and is shallow and filled with huge serpents. Sometimes they ride the wind and smash ships. Here are islands where the camphor tree grows. The fifth sea is called Salahit and is very large and filled with wonders. The sixth sea is called Kardanj; it is very rainy. The seventh sea is called the sea of Sanji, also known as Kanjli. It is the sea of China; one is driven by the south wind until one reaches a freshwater bay, along which are fortified places and cities, until one reaches Khanfu.[7]

This passage demonstrates the Seven Seas as referenced in Medieval Arabian literature: the Persian Gulf ("Sea of Fars"), the Arabian Sea ("Sea of Larwi"[8]), the Bay of Bengal ("Sea of Harkand"[9]), the Strait of Malacca ("Sea of Kalah"[10]), the Singapore Strait ("Sea of Salahit"[11]), the Gulf of Thailand ("Sea of Kardanj"[10]), and the South China Sea ("Sea of Sanji"[10]).
