# Introduction {#intro}

## History of analytic software
**R** is an implementation of the **S** programming language and created by *Ross Ihaka* and *Robert Gentleman*. at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.R is named partly after the first names of the first two R authors and partly as a play on the name of S. The project was conceived in **1992**, with an initial version released in 1995 and a stable beta version in 2000.

**Python** is created by *Guido van Rossum* in **1991**.Python 3.0 was released on **2008**.

**S** is a statistical programming language developed primarily by *John Chambers* at Bell Laboratories in **1975**.

Structured Query Language[**SQL**] was initially developed at IBM by *Donald D. Chamberlin* and *Raymond F. Boyce* in **1970**.

*Cleve Moler*, the chairman of the computer science department at the University of New Mexico, started developing **MATLAB** in the late **1970**.

The development of **SAS** began in **1966** at North Carolina State University by *Anthony Barr* and his student *James Goodnight*(current CEO of SAS).


```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("PMassicotte/gtrendsR")
library(gtrendsR)
res <- gtrends("sko", geo = "NO", cat = "18")
head(res$interest_over_time)
```
```{r echo = TRUE,message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
google_trend<- read.csv("multiTimeline001.csv", header=TRUE,skip=1)
p <- plot_ly(google_trend, x = ~Week, y = ~R...Worldwide.,name = 'R', type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines')%>%
  add_trace(y = ~SQL...Worldwide., name = 'SQL', mode = 'lines')%>%
  add_trace(y = ~Python...Worldwide., name = 'Python', mode = 'lines')%>%
    layout(title = "Past 5 years Google Trends",
       xaxis = list(title = "Date"),
       yaxis = list (title = "Interest"))

## Install Python

R is a **free software** environment for statistical computing and graphics.Download R at CRAN:[www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/)

**CRAN** stand for The Comprehensive R Archive Network. It is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R.

**CRAN** is maintained by the efforts of volunteers (the 'CRAN team').That is a group of talent who contribute their time and expertise to make better **Package**

## Install anaconda


Download R Studio:[www.rstudio.com](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

Anaconda is the world’s most popular Python data science platform. Anaconda, Inc. continues to lead open source projects like Anaconda, NumPy and SciPy 
that form the foundation of modern data science. Anaconda’s flagship product, Anaconda Enterprise, allows organizations to secure, govern, 
scale and extend Anaconda to deliver actionable insights that drive businesses and industries forward.

Spyder is an **integrated development environment (IDE)** for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.
