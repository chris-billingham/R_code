## Cleaning

For the remainder of the report, we will look only at data from the year . We aggregate our data by location, using the *R* code below.


* **temp** - The mean monthly air temperature near the surface of the Earth (measured in degrees kelvin (*K*))

* **pressure** - The mean monthly air pressure at the surface of the Earth (measured in millibars (*mb*))

* **ozone** - The mean monthly abundance of atmospheric ozone (measured in Dobson units (*DU*))


You can convert the temperature unit from Kelvin to Celsius with the formula

$$ celsius = kelvin - 273.15 $$

```{r}
library(nasaweather)
library(dplyr)
library(ggvis)

year <- 1995

means <- atmos %>%
  filter(year == year) %>%
  group_by(long, lat) %>%
  summarize(temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE),
         pressure = mean(pressure, na.rm = TRUE),
         ozone = mean(ozone, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudlow = mean(cloudlow, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudmid = mean(cloudmid, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudhigh = mean(cloudhigh, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()
```
